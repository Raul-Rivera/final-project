# Final Project - CS50‚Äôs Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

_Designing a online Kids Learning Web Application with Python and JavaScript._


## Description: üìã

_This Website was created with the purpose of providing educational online courses for children and teenagers. First, people will have the option to view the page and the available courses, with the option of registering to be able to browse the section of available courses, filter them by categories and by words. They will also be able to see details of each available course, which includes an image, description, rating and review in which they will be able to qualify and give their opinion. Second, I wanted each user to have more options when making their purchase, therefore, each available course will have a special addition and free additions with which the registered user will feel more comfortable when making their purchase. Third, registered users will be able to add or delete courses from the shopping cart, to be able to buy the courses, to view the purchase orders and the status of the transaction. Finally, after the user makes his purchase, the user can read a thank you message in order to strengthen them and make him a constant buyer._


## Requirements: üìå

* Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those.
```
Meet this requirement
```
* Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.
```
Meet this requirement
```
* Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
```
Meet this requirement
```
* In a README.md in your project‚Äôs main directory, include a writeup describing your project, what‚Äôs contained in each file you created, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project. This file should also provide your justification for why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.
```

```
* If you‚Äôve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to a requirements.txt file!

## My opinion about this latest project: ü§ì

_To complete the final project. I encountered a variety of problems that I had to deal with. Then, I outlined the main issues that would be involved in project completion and worked backward to break down the work that should be done at each stage_

_I created a list of all the possible risks that could prevent me from reaching my goal, and then added some extra time to the schedule in case something unexpected came up. I also made sure to dedicate enough time to each part of the project according to its complexity. The project was completed on time, but looking back, I realize there were some issues that could have been avoided. For example, I would have avoided being so meticulous in design to avoid some of the minor programming problems I encountered. Having said that, it's always easier to see what it is that I learned after I complete the project, and now I know what I would do differently next time_

_Also, I want to say that this project has been a challenge, with its complexities and errors, I learned a lot and I know that I will be able to apply what I learned in future projects oriented to this same field, I really enjoyed doing all the projects and it was a pleasure always listen to the videos and I was able to make what I had in mind come true, thanks for everything._
